            Device to assist in Polar Alignment of an equatorial camera mount.
          </h2>

          <p>
            This project idea is designed to assist in polar alignment for an
            equatorial camera mount. Polar alignment is an absolute must step
            when shooting astrophotography, if the mount isn't lined up
            correctly when shooting long exposure photos you will get what's
            called “star trails”(see photo to the right). And while it's not an
            over complicated task by any means it can be a tedious exercise
            every time you want to take some photos. While there are several
            self-aligning mounts on the market those products are incredibly
            expensive, coming in at $2000 on the cheaper end putting them a
            little out of reach for your everyday astro nerd. This project will
            attempt to leverage Arduino technology mounted to the camera mount
            displaying the information needed for polar alignment.

          <p class="p1">
            My motivation for this project is admittedly a bit of a selfish one,
            as mentioned above polar aligning the mount is a pain. For those
            unable to afford an expensive self-aligning mount, the current best
            method involves trying to hold your phone flush against the mount
            with a compass app open while making adjustments with the other
            hand. This project would yield such an amazing quality of life
            improvement for me, and based on all the instructional videos I
            watched when getting started I think it's something that hobbyist
            astrophotography geeks everywhere would appreciate.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            To polar align the mount you only need two pieces of information,
            know your latitude and your heading. To achieve this the device will
            you use a GPS module attached to an Arduino Uno board to return the
            users coordinates, although you only need to know latitude to adjust
            the elevation of the mount both would be needed for a later step in
            development. For the compass, the device will use a magnetometer
            module. For this to function optimally you need to know your
            magnetic declination, (the amount of variation between the magnetic
            pole and true north). This information can be found at
            https://www.magnetic-declination.com/.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Ultimately I would like to incorporate a WIFI module onto the board
            and have the device connect to the internet and pull users magnetic
            declination automatically, adjusting the numbers in the programs
            code on start up. This however is a quite a bit outside my area of
            expertise, so for now the added accuracy by entering in your
            magnetic declination will remain a manual task. Checking the
            declination of the location you will be shooting from via the above
            website and amending the code accordingly beforehand, of course if
            shooting from the same location (e.g. a backyard) this is only a one
            time step. You have to travel for a good while before a change in
            declination would be required.

            Next is has to be mounted to the cameras equatorial mount. This is
            going to be a custom 3D printed enclosure housing the components,
            allowing the base of the enclosure to be able to slide directly into
            the mounts motor rails. The flexibility of 3D printing will also
            mean being able to have different base options for different brands
            of equatorial mounts. Set into the top of this housing will be a
            screen displaying users coordinates and magnetic heading.
          </p>
          <p>
            To aid in aligning the mount with as little confusion as possible,
            in addition to the screen displaying the users heading the device
            will use a beep in conjunction with current heading. With the
            intervals of the beep increasing and decreasing the closer or
            further away respectively the user is from south, ending with a
            continuous beep when south is achieved. Using both visual and audio
            data representation will make this device completely hands free and
            super easy to use, and as I will touch on below being able to hot
            swap this device into the mount will make doing a slight location
            changes quick enough to be actually worth considering.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            There is brainstorming happening on an alternate housing design and
            mounting method allowing the device to be installed as a permanent
            fixture, potentially bolted between the tripod and the equatorial
            mounts base plate. This would take the design from a 1-piece housing
            to a more segmented design with the bulk of the device needing to be
            mounted to the tripods legs so as to not interfere with the cameras
            rotation during shooting. This is the eventual goal for this
            project, along with the use of a WIFI function as mentioned above.
            This product would be a must any amateur astro photography
            enthusiast.

            The software being used for this project is the Arduino IDE
            associated with the board available for free download at
            https://www.arduino.cc/en/software. Also on the site over at the
            documentation tab are hundreds of tutorials and documentation
            required to gain the necessary skills needed for programming the
            board. In addition to the Arduino Uno board itself the device will
            use a BN-880 GPS module with built-in HMC5883L magnetometer, giving
            visual and audio through use of a basic 16x2 LCD display and Buzzer.
            With the potential addition of a ESP8266 WIFI module or similar in
            later development. All of these components are readily available
            from countless online retailers at relatively low cost, and thanks
            to an active Arduino community and official documentation there are
            guides and templates out there for all of these modules. Lastly is
            the 3D printed enclosure which will require the most design work as
            well as needing some knowledge of a 3D design software such as
            AutoCAD. The printing itself can easily be out sourced to a number
            of companies that will take your design and produce anything from
            single units to thousands, at again relatively low cost.

            If this project is successful it will mean having a reliable,
            consistent and efficient way to get setup for a night of
            astrophotography. Not only will it make setup orders of magnitude
            easier, but to be able to quickly and easily do checks throughout
            the session if you happen to bump the tripod or decide to move the
            whole setup slightly for a better line of sight. I would like to
            think that with the all of the incredible things happening in the
            space industry such as the recently deployed James Web Space
            Telescope to name only one, and the fact that these events are
            getting tonnes of media attention gives me hope that more folks will
            be inspired to go out and capture a piece of this vast and possibly
            infinite universe we live in. It would be my hope that this device
            could make getting started with astrophotography a slightly less
            daunting and more enjoyable experience, taking the most of the guess
            work out of the alignment process. While preserving some sanity for
            when you have to learn the editing process.
