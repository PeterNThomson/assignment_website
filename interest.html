            <h2 class="subhead">Interest in IT</h2>
            <p class="p1">IT has been an obsession of mine as far back as I can remember, I was 
                fortunate enough to get my first PC at 8 years old when the company my 
                mum worked for were upgrading their systems. While the majority of my 
                time on computers was playing video games with a bit of rudimentary photo 
                editing, but on February 6th, 2018, when SpaceX's Falcon Heavy test  flight 
                happened and I watched those side boosters landing side by side as if 
                straight out of science fiction the passion and excitement for the ever-
                evolving world of technology was ignited like never before.</p>
            <p class="p2">With such a strong passion for IT choosing to study at RMIT was really a no 
                brainer. With an excellent global reputation and courses run by experts in 
                their field, who are ensuring that the information and skills they teach are 
                relevant in a constantly evolving industry. Having not studied for many 
                years I was a little nervous to take the plunge, but right out of the gate the 
                incredible staff and their knowledge/support has made me wish I did this 
                years ago.</p> 
            <p class="p3">The goal I have for my studies at RMIT is to gather as much knowledge and 
                relevant skills as I can across a range of areas within the IT industry. While I 
                have dream companies I would love to work for, the exact pathway and the 
                position at those companies isn't so clear. My intension is to get hands on 
                with a variety of disciplines throughout the industry to find the area that I 
                think I have the potential to excel at.</p>
