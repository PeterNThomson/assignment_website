          <p>
            IT has been an obsession of mine as far back as I can remember, I
            was fortunate enough to get my first PC at 8 years old when the
            company my mum worked for were upgrading their systems. While the
            majority of my time on computers was playing video games with a bit
            of rudimentary photo editing, but on February 6th, 2018, when
            SpaceX's Falcon Heavy test flight happened and I watched those side
            boosters landing side by side as if straight out of science fiction
            the passion and excitement for the ever- evolving world of
            technology was ignited like never before.
          </p>
          <p>
            With such a strong passion for IT choosing to study at RMIT was
            really a no brainer. With an excellent global reputation and courses
            run by experts in their field, who are ensuring that the information
            and skills they teach are relevant in a constantly evolving
            industry. Having not studied for many years I was a little nervous
            to take the plunge, but right out of the gate the incredible staff
            and their knowledge/support has made me wish I did this years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal I have for my studies at RMIT is to gather as much
            knowledge and relevant skills as I can across a range of areas
            within the IT industry. While I have dream companies I would love to
            work for, the exact pathway and the position at those companies
            isn't so clear. My intension is to get hands on with a variety of
            disciplines throughout the industry to find the area that I think I
            have the potential to excel at.
