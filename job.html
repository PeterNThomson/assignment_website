            <p class="p1">The position I have listed is a software engineer role at SpaceX, after reading 
                about where my interests in IT not necessarily came from but where they 
                were definitely sparked by. It should come as no surprise that SpaceX is a 
                company I aspire to work for. </p>
            <p class="p2">It is a software engineer's role at SpaceX to create new and maintain existing 
                systems across the Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon family of spacecraft, 
                as well as perform on-site support in mission control during vehicle launch. 
                With Starship and SpaceX's pursuit of Mars looking more and more like a 
                reality by the day, being part of a company at the forefront of technological 
                innovation and that has such a passion for the future of mankind would be a 
                dream come true.</p>
            <p class="p3">The preferred skills and qualifications for a role working with such expensive 
                systems and in some launch scenarios systems where failure could mean the 
                loss of life, are understandably quite extensive. It requires a Bachelor's degree 
                with at least 5 years professional experience. A broad and in-depth knowledge 
                of software engineering principles, networking, debugging and the ability to 
                carry out work accurately in high stress environments such as launch 
                operations. It is preferred to have several years experience in LabView's 
                graphical programming environment as well as with Python, C++ or other 
                object-oriented language.</p>
            <p class="p4">As a student with no previous experience these are all skills that I will need to 
                develop over time. This is by no means a job I will be able to fill directly out of 
                university, as mentioned above at least 5 years of professional experience is 
                required with chunks of that experience requirement allocated to particular 
                skill sets. Given that it is not always guaranteed to land an ideal role within a 
                company but often they can require working up to, I anticipate it to take 
                considerably longer than 5 years to achieve the necessary skills and 
                qualifications required for a successful application at a company like SpaceX.</p>
