          <p>
            The position I have listed is a software engineer role at SpaceX,
            after reading about where my interests in IT not necessarily came
            from but where they were definitely sparked by. It should come as no
            surprise that SpaceX is a company I aspire to work for.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a software engineer's role at SpaceX to create new and
            maintain existing systems across the Falcon launch vehicle and
            Dragon family of spacecraft, as well as perform on-site support in
            mission control during vehicle launch. With Starship and SpaceX's
            pursuit of Mars looking more and more like a reality by the day,
            being part of a company at the forefront of technological innovation
            and that has such a passion for the future of mankind would be a
            dream come true.
          </p>
          <p>
            The preferred skills and qualifications for a role working with such
            expensive systems and in some launch scenarios systems where failure
            could mean the loss of life, are understandably quite extensive. It
            requires a Bachelor's degree with at least 5 years professional
            experience. A broad and in-depth knowledge of software engineering
            principles, networking, debugging and the ability to carry out work
            accurately in high stress environments such as launch operations. It
            is preferred to have several years experience in LabView's graphical
            programming environment as well as with Python, C++ or other
            object-oriented language.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            As a student with no previous experience these are all skills that I
            will need to develop over time. This is by no means a job I will be
            able to fill directly out of university, as mentioned above at least
            5 years of professional experience is required with chunks of that
            experience requirement allocated to particular skill sets. Given
            that it is not always guaranteed to land an ideal role within a
            company but often they can require working up to, I anticipate it to
            take considerably longer than 5 years to achieve the necessary
            skills and qualifications required for a successful application at a
            company like SpaceX.
