          <p class="about_me">
            I was born and raised in Western Australia attending school in the
            city before moving outwards to the country. Up until this point in
            my life I have worked predominantly as a chef, with some positions
            allowing me to work and see some extremely remote and amazing areas
            of this country. My time away from the light pollution of the city
            also inspired me to pick up astro photography as a hobby (which I'll
            admit is not very good friends with my bank balance). But with
            COVID-19 came a fair amount of uncertainty in the hospitality
            industry giving me the motivation I needed to go after a dream I've
            had for far too long.
