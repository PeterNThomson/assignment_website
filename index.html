            <p class="about_me">I was born and raised in Western Australia attending school 
                in the city before moving outwards to the country. Up until this point in my 
                life I have worked predominantly as a chef, with some positions allowing me 
                to work and see some extremely remote and amazing areas of this country.  My 
                time away from the light pollution of the city also inspired me to pick up 
                astro photography as a hobby (which I'll admit is not very good friends 
                with my bank balance). But with COVID-19 came a fair amount of 
                uncertainty in the hospitality industry giving me the motivation I needed 
                to go after a dream I've had for far too long.</p>
