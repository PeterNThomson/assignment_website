            The results of these test didn't really return anything too
            surprising if I'm being honest. I have always been quite a solitary
            person, particularly with my time outside of work. To some extent in
            my work life as well with commercial kitchens having a fairly clear
            cut “this is your part of the job, not someone else's job” kind of
            mentality. So coming out on the side on introverted was definitely
            not a shock. The Myers-Briggs coming out slightly on the side of
            feeling over thinking I guess was a little curious.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            As the results have shown and indeed something I have been aware of,
            and has been a focus of self-improvement is my lacking social
            skills. My hope is that taking this course through RMIT will not
            only give me the IT skills, but help me better contribute in a group
            setting and the confidence to take the lead in areas that I do hold
            strength in. When forming and operating within a team environment I
            enjoy working alongside people with a variety of viewpoints and
            opinions, I feel that exposing yourself to people with ideas that
            conflict your own help you grow as person.

            I'm a very down to earth and easy going kind of guy which is
            something that has seen me do very well is group settings.
            Disregarding my social skills which for now we'll label as “Under
            Construction”, my other skills and strengths such as conflict
            resolution and ironically being quite good at reading people despite
            my introversion, along with my attention detail and willingness to
            learn will give me the ability to be an engaging and compassionate
            team member. And give me the exposure I need to improve the
            aforementioned character weaknesses.
